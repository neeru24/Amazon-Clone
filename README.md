# Amazon-like Website
This project is an Amazon-like website prototype built using HTML, CSS, and FontAwesome icons. It mimics some of the basic functionalities and layout of the Amazon website.

## Technologies Used
• HTML: Provides the structure of the web page. <br>
• CSS: Styles the elements and adds visual effects. <br>
• FontAwesome: Provides icons used for navigation and decoration. <br>

### HTML Structure:
• The HTML structure defines the layout of the web page. <br>
• It includes elements such as header, div, footer, and various div containers with classes for styling and organization. <br>
• Inside the header, there's a navigation bar (navbar) with sections for the logo, delivery address, search bar, user sign-in, returns and orders, and the shopping cart. <br>
• The panel section contains additional navigation options. <br>
• The hero-section displays a message with a link. <br>
• The shop-section contains boxes representing different product categories. <br>
• The footer includes sections for different links and information. <br>
### CSS Styling:
• CSS is used to style the HTML elements, providing colors, fonts, layout, and other visual effects. <br>
• Selectors like .navbar, .box, .hero-section, and .footer are used to target specific elements and apply styling rules. <br>
• Properties like background-color, height, width, border, font-size, and margin are used to customize the appearance of elements. <br>
• CSS classes like .border:hover and .searchicon define styles for hover effects and specific elements. <br>
### FontAwesome Icons:
• FontAwesome is a library that provides scalable vector icons that can be easily customized using CSS. <br>
• Icons like fa-bars, fa-location-dot, fa-magnifying-glass, fa-cart-shopping, and others are used to represent different elements in the navigation bar and other sections. <br>

## Note
• This project is a prototype and does not include actual e-commerce functionality. It's meant for demonstration purposes only. <br>
• Images used in the project are for illustration purposes and do not represent actual products. <br> 
• FontAwesome icons are used for decorative purposes and to simulate the appearance of the Amazon website. <br>
